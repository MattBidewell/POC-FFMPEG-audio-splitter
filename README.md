# POC FFMPEG audio splitter

This is a personal proof of concept. 

Using FFMPEG WASM module split a piece of audio on the silence.

Example usecase: A voice over artist is recording something in one long recording, they pause for 3 seconds between each line. If the whole recording was "uploaded" the this webapp then the process and split the entire audio file. 

## why?

Introduction to WASM, also has a potential realistic use case. This is the POC built using React, full version is being built using Vue.
